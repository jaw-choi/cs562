In the projects, you can move global light's position with Imgui.
Also, can check if you want to see layout of the local lights.
You can move your screen your mouse click and drag.

In some Imgui issue, there are some problem in layout of the g-buffer. But I can see the layout with Render Doc program.
If I turn on the Blend when I draw g-buffer, the layout in the imgui comes out.
but If I turn off it does not.
